This is a simple weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API. 

This application will ask you to share your location, if you do, it will update to show you the current weather for your location. If you choose not to share your location or want to check the weather in another location you can type in the name of a city and if found, it will return the weather for that location.

Future versions of this application may include actually showing a localized Leaflet map with weather layers.
